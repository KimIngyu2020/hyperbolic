Install
=======

hyperbolic is available on PyPI:

::

    $ pip3 install hyperbolic

Install drawSvg also to display the hyperbolic geometry:

::

    $ pip3 install drawSvg

Examples
========

See the iPython notebooks in
`examples <https://github.com/cduck/hyperbolic/tree/master/examples>`__:

-  `Euclidean
   geometry <https://github.com/cduck/hyperbolic/blob/master/examples/euclid.ipynb>`__
-  `Poincaré disk
   model <https://github.com/cduck/hyperbolic/blob/master/examples/poincare.ipynb>`__
-  `Tiling the Poincaré
   disk <https://github.com/cduck/hyperbolic/blob/master/examples/tiles.ipynb>`__

Using this library, along with the drawSvg library, you can create art
like this hyperbolic weave:

   :alt: Hyperbolic weave

This weave is built from a tiling of isosceles triangles:
